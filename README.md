- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tobypiv
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in: *you guessed it - **programming***
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: *programming*, but specifically JavaScript and most things related including, TS, Nodejs and Im waiting for the motivation to learn WebGL 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: **please don't**

By most standards, I suck at programming, but I really enjoy it and the only reason I'm on Github is it's a convenient place to store my code, and it sounds cool if you say *my code's on Github* :P
